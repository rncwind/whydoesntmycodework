# Coffee

I used to never drink coffee.

I used to _hate_ coffee, and hot drinks in general.

What started out as a method of ingesting caffiene to get me through high school
and 6th form, has since evolved into a deep love, and appreciation for the most
traded, non-petrochemical comodity in the world.

I have been asked by two sepperate people to write about my love for coffee, and
so here we go.

## Coffee, more than caffiene
You thought this would be me just talking about coffee i like and how i make it?
Please this is going to be me writing about a hyperfixation instead!

Coffee is the 2nd most traded commodity in the world, behind crude oil. By all
accounts it powers the industrial machine we are fittingly ground against every
day, however it did not start out this way.

Coffee made its way into the grinders of the world through a series of happy accidents.

<!-- , rather than just talk about _How_ i make my coffee, I would rather take you -->
<!-- through the journey I took, before arriving where I am today. -->

<!-- ## Young life -->

<!-- Coffee to child-me was always a drink for adults. When I tried it, I was never -->
<!-- sure as to why people would drink it, it's bitter, astringent, and takes ages to -->
<!-- make after all. -->

<!-- My perception in this period of my life was coloured by the instant coffee my -->
<!-- parents drank, or the infernal elixir known as "Camp Coffee", a viscious, oilly -->
<!-- concerntrate of chickory and coffee that my grandparents were fond of. -->

<!-- ## Early Teenage Years -->

<!-- Now this is where the seeds (or, i guess beans) are planted in my mind. I'm -->
<!-- wandering through a supermarket with my grandparents, it's more upmarket than -->
<!-- i'm used to, and it has an extensive coffee selection. -->
<!-- Bored, and waiting for the others to grab what they are after, i start looking -->
<!-- at the coffee. One thing i notice is that there's such a huge variety, and -->
<!-- most interestingly to my young self, such a large range of price points. -->

<!-- Whilst you could get a bag of generic starbucks and costa coffee beans for about -->
<!-- £3.50, there were bags from names that i'd never heard of before that were -->
<!-- hitting the double digits! I remember vividly one in particular which is from a -->
<!-- roaster i'm now aware of, called Union coffee roasters. It was about £9.50 a bag -->
<!-- and it said it was "heirloom". I had _no idea_ what this meant, and i didn't -->
<!-- have a smartphone at the time, and i knew i didn't have anythign to brew it -->
<!-- with, so i put the bag back on the shelf, and eventually made my way home. -->

<!-- Once back, i started reading, first about what "heirloom coffee" is, and then -->
<!-- about the process in general. It sure beat doing GCSE homework! -->

<!-- ## Late teens and 6th Form. -->
<!-- My parents got a coffee machine! In the uk, pod machines like nespresso are less -->
<!-- popualr than they are in the USA, and "pads" are more common. This machine was a -->
<!-- "pad" machine. You put in a little puck of coffee, wrapped in some form of -->
<!-- paper, and water would percolate through producing a cup of hot brown liquid. -->

<!-- I tried it black a few times and realised it wasn't for me. -->
