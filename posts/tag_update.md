# Small blog update

Just a small post to say that tags now work on the blog! Hopefully you
should be able to click the #blog-meta text at the top of this post and be
whisked away to all of my other writings about how the proverbial vegan sausage
is made.

As for now, this isn't super useful, but hopefully as the blog grows it will pay
off.

Along with this, I've made a few small changes to the blog's CSS, mostly to fix
uneven padding on headings which felt a bit stilted at lower resolutions and
mobile devices.

## Personal update

I was part of a layoff at my previous employer, so for the next 3 or so weeks
I'm between jobs!
If you need a rust contractor for the next 2 weeks give me a shout!
Hopefully this will give me enough time to finish up some of my unfinished
posts, and write up some of the interesting bits i'm currently working on!
