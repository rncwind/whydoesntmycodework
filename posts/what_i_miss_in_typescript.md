# I don't hate typescript

A lot of people are surprised when I say this. After all, I work with Rust every
day, some of my favourite languages are Haskell and Lisp, I use NixOS even! The
ECMAScript ecosystem is a far cry away from what I enjoy using, why is it then,
that I don't hate typescript?

The answer is simple, i'd rather have _a_ type system (Even if it is full of
holes thanks to Gradual Typing) than the absolute joke that ECMAScript has by default.

# What it's missing
- Pattern Matching
- Monadic Error Handling

# What it has instead
- Case statements
- Try-Catch
